1. Setting up a new Django project and creating your first app

When to use: At the beginning of a new Django project or when adding a new component to an existing project.
Why to use: To establish the basic structure of your Django project and create a modular component (app) for specific functionality.
How to use: Use Django's command-line tools to create a project and an app within it.
Pros:
- Provides a standardized project structure
- Encourages modular development
- Automatically sets up necessary files and configurations
Cons:
- May create some files you don't need for very simple projects
- Requires understanding of Django's project structure
Steps:
1. Install Django: `pip install django`
2. Create a new project: `django-admin startproject myproject`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd myproject`
4. Create a new app: `python manage.py startapp myapp`
5. Add the app to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py

2. Django MTV (Model-Template-View) architecture

When to use: When developing any Django application.
Why to use: To understand and effectively implement Django's architectural pattern.
How to use: Organize your code into models (data structure), templates (presentation), and views (business logic).
Pros:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Promotes code reusability and maintainability
- Follows Django's "batteries included" philosophy
Cons:
- Learning curve for developers used to traditional MVC
- Can be overkill for very simple applications
Steps:
1. Define models in models.py
2. Create templates in a templates directory
3. Write view functions or classes in views.py
4. Connect views to URLs in urls.py

3. Writing a basic model for a blog post

When to use: When you need to define the data structure for blog posts in your application.
Why to use: To create a database schema and provide an abstraction layer for working with blog post data.
How to use: Define a Python class that inherits from django.db.models.Model.
Pros:
- Provides an object-oriented interface to your database
- Automatically creates database tables
- Enables use of Django's ORM for querying
Cons:
- May not be suitable for very complex data structures
- Can lead to performance issues if not used carefully
Steps:
1. In models.py:
   ```python
   from django.db import models
   from django.contrib.auth.models import User

   class BlogPost(models.Model):
       title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
       content = models.TextField()
       author = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
       pub_date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

       def __str__(self):
           return self.title
   ```
2. Run migrations: `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate`

4. Creating a view function to display a list of all blog posts

When to use: When you need to retrieve and display a list of blog posts.
Why to use: To handle the logic of fetching data from the database and passing it to a template.
How to use: Define a function in views.py that queries the database and renders a template.
Pros:
- Separates business logic from presentation
- Allows for easy modification of data before passing to template
Cons:
- Can become complex for views with multiple data sources or operations
Steps:
1. In views.py:
   ```python
   from django.shortcuts import render
   from .models import BlogPost

   def post_list(request):
       posts = BlogPost.objects.all().order_by('-pub_date')
       return render(request, 'blog/post_list.html', {'posts': posts})
   ```
2. Create a template file 'blog/post_list.html' to display the posts

5. Creating a URL pattern to map a URL to a view function

When to use: When you need to connect a URL to a specific view in your Django application.
Why to use: To define the routing structure of your application and map URLs to views.
How to use: Add URL patterns to your app's urls.py file and include it in the project's main urls.py.
Pros:
- Provides a centralized place to manage URL routing
- Allows for dynamic URL patterns with parameters
Cons:
- Can become complex for large applications with many URLs
Steps:
1. In your app's urls.py:
   ```python
   from django.urls import path
   from . import views

   urlpatterns = [
       path('posts/', views.post_list, name='post_list'),
   ]
   ```
2. In your project's main urls.py, include the app's URLs:
   ```python
   from django.urls import path, include

   urlpatterns = [
       path('blog/', include('blog.urls')),
   ]
   ```
